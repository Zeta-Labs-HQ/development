# Plugin system

## Why?

Plugin system is a way to extend Riemann with new functionality. Every bot differs, and has a different way
to work with things, especially external services, custom internal wrappers, etc.

This empowers and creates new way to enable *anyone* make their own plugins with the consistent API provided
by `riemann-plugins` repository.
